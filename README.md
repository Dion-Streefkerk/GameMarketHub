## Introduction

LucaStars is thrilled with the games delivered in the previous block. Together with CEO Bert Rongil, the marketing department has decided to offer these games for sale in a specially built webshop. Now, everyone who enjoys text-based adventures will have a fantastic selection to choose from!

This project involves building a webshop for the games developed in Block 3. It utilizes modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Express.js for endpoints, and Lit for web components.
